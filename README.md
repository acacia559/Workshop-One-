in the previous workshop I had made the sketch move and leave a trail by accident but when I came back to it this morning I was able to complete the code correctly so that it moved across the screen without this. This became my starting point for workshop one.

I found adding the bounce loop easier than the previous trials so I feel like I am starting to get the hang of things and will soon start experimenting and problem solving more on my own. 

I was really creatively struggling with the workshop tasks so I came back to this point and made a bear shape to turn into a function
